## Chicken:
* Little diced bits --> popcorn Chicken
* 1/4c flour, 1/3tb cayenne, some garlic powder, some paprika, salt, pepper
* Fry at 350, triple dredge

## Buffalo Sauce:
* Make roux first. Find real recipe.
* 2 tb butter 3 tb flour?
* Add hot sauce, whisk in
* Worstichershire sauce
* But it needs another liquid I think? Maybe not. Maybe just don't make such a giant roux to begin with.

## Potatoes:
* Don't start too early, they got cold.
* Roast garlic

## Ingredients:
* Chicken
* Cayenne Pepper, Worstch, Salt/Pepper, Paprika, Garlic Powder, flour
* Potatoes
* Garlic

## Pitfalls:
* I tried twice making a mix of hotsauce/butter, roughly equal portions, and this seemed ok but then either heat or corn starch or both made the butter separate out.
