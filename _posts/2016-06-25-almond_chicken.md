# Almond Chicken

* Breaded... soon to be fried?
* Created in memory of downriver Detroit Chinese food.

# Stuff Needed

* Rice
* Breaded chicken
  * Almonds
  * Panko breading
  * Butter
* Broccoli
* Water chestnuts
* Tiny corns?
* Garlic
* Sauce:
  * Corn starch
  * Chicken broth (1.5? cups)
  * Soy sauce
  * Butter
  * Chicken bouillon

# Procedure

* Make rice
* Roast fresh garlic if available
* Chop broccoli
* Do chicken:
  * Make breading:
    * Almonds, chopped
    * Panko
    * Spices
    * Chicken bouillon
  * Chicken + melted butter + breading -> High walled baking pan. I've found the panko burned on a cookie sheet but hasn't been burning in a deeper cake pan. More testing needed!
  * I make popcorn chicken, because we're picky meaters. Baking this in popcorn size at 425 for 20 minutes brings it 20-30 degrees above 'finished', but Dealgnaid also likes her meat a little dry.
* Do veggies:
  * Steam broccoli, remove
  * Fry waterchestnuts + garlic
  * Add broccoli in for a few minutes
  * Seasonings?
* Do sauce:
  * Don't turn on heat until everythings in the pan, it's so much easier than trying to keep the corn starch from saucing while measuring out flavor.
  * 2? Tb corn starch, 1.5? Tb water, smooth in pan
    * Maybe more up front when doing the no-heat-until-everythings-there method?
  * 1 can or 1.5 cups chicken broth
  * 2 Tb soy sauce
  * 2 Tb chicken bouillon
  * 2 Tb butter
  * Bring to boil, simmer, saucify.
