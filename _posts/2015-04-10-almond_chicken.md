# Almond Breaded or Fried Chicken

* Apparently a creation of Michigan Chinese restaurants.
* Start 1c rice before beginning.
* Preheat oven to 400 if frying, 450 if baking.

## Prep Work

* Chop up broccoli, 1/4c almonds, and 2 garlic cloves.
* Prepare battering stuff: Egg plate, flour plate.
* Batter:
  * 1/8c flour
  * 1/4c almonds
  * 1/8c milk
  * 1/8c water
  * <2 Tbs baking powder
  * Pinch salt
  * This mixture was very difficult to apply and left parts of each chicken unbreaded after cooking. It was delicious, though.
* Butterfly and trim chicken, cut into chunks for frying, save a little bit for browning the saucepan.

## Cooking

* Start frying chickens once oven is preheating and rice is cooking and other prep work is done. You might want to leave more prep work for while the chicken is in the oven if you suck at frying and prefer to bake it to absolute-done-ness.
* Make sauce once chicken is in oven:
  * Fry extra unbreaded pieces of chicken and garlic.
  * 2 Tbs corn starch and 1.5 Tbs water, mixed smooth.
  * Add 1.5c chicken broth (approx 1 can)
  * Add 2 tbs soy sauce, 3 Tbs butter, 2 tbs bouillon.
  * Heat to a boil, boil a couple minutes til thickened
  * Probably thicken it with some extra corn starch in the end.
* Steam broccoli.
