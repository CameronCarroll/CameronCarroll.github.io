# Almond Breaded or Fried Chicken

* Apparently a creation of Michigan Chinese restaurants.
* Start 1c rice before beginning.
* Preheat oven to 400 if frying, 450 if baking.

## Prep Work

* Chop up broccoli, 1/4c almonds, and 2 garlic cloves.
* Prepare battering stuff: Egg plate, flour plate.
* Batter:
  * 1/8c flour
  * 1/4c almonds
  * 1/8c milk
  * 1/8c water
  * <2 Tbs baking powder
  * Pinch salt
  * This mixture was very difficult to apply and left parts of each chicken unbreaded after cooking. It was delicious, though.
* Butterfly and trim chicken, cut into chunks for frying, save a little bit for browning the saucepan.

## Cooking

* Start frying chickens once oven is preheating and rice is cooking and other prep work is done. You might want to leave more prep work for while the chicken is in the oven if you suck at frying and prefer to bake it to absolute-done-ness.
* Make sauce once chicken is in oven:
  * Fry extra unbreaded pieces of chicken and garlic.
  * 2 Tbs corn starch and 1.5 Tbs water, mixed smooth.
  * Add 1.5c chicken broth (approx 1 can)
  * Add 2 tbs soy sauce, 3 Tbs butter, 2 tbs bouillon.
  * Heat to a boil, boil a couple minutes til thickened
  * Probably thicken it with some extra corn starch in the end.
* Steam broccoli.

## Log

### 7/24/15

* Rice was dry; Fill it up a little bit past the line when using the long grain costco bag rice.
* I used a grip of almonds at first when making the batter, and then tried the 1/8 flour 1/8 milk 1/8 water mixture. This was hilariously ineffective. I added maybe another 1/2c??? liquid and 1/4c??? flour as well as 1/2??? Tbs baking powder. But only gradually, and the first ones I tried to fry ended up only with batter on top. So definitely get the batter pretty liquidy. Also I tried dipping the pieces in a tiny bit of water after flouring and I think it did help to get more flour on them. The best temperature for frying is more like 330, I think?
* Oh, and when I put the battered pieces into the oil all of the big chunks of batter just fell right off and made a mess in the pot, so make sure to really break the almonds down more.
* For the sauce, I mixed 3 tbs of the corn starch and slightly more than 2 tbs water and poured this into the chicken stock, just after frying some protein in the pan. In the end, this made a beautiful sauce without me having to add any extra corn starch at the end. In practice, it needed to be whisked in immediately to homogenize and was thickening into completion before I could even get all of the flavorings in there. Also by the time babe was ready to eat it, it had solidified and needed to be stirred and was a little gross.
* When I put the chicken in the oven, I buttered the bottom of the pan but I think that was a mistake, as most of the pieces came out a little soft on the bottom, and some of them were pretty much completely inedible.
* Oh and it turns out you don't need to egg it before battering.
