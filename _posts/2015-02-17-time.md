# Time and Dual Booting
According to the [Arch Wiki on Time](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time), we should set the RTC to use UTC time rather than localtime and make Windows behave using a registry fix. (It normally requires localtime RTC.)

I guess I must have accidently left the RTC to localtime, because Linux was displaying something very strange in timedatectl. I wish I had kept the logs. Like localtime and UTC were swapped or something?

Anyway, the time was all screwy. What I actually did to fix it was reinstall tzdata, install NTP and try to synchronize it, and set the RTC to universal, although went I went back to check the RTC had reset to localtime and I DID have to hack Windows time to get things to work. (Literally told it I'm in Casablanca.)
{% highlight bash %}
sudo pacman -S tzdata ntp
sudo ntpd -q
timedatectl set-local-rtc 0
{% endhighlight %}
