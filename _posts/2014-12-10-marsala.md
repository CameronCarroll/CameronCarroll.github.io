# Chicken Mushroom Marsala
[Original Source: Cooking for Engineers (Michael Chu)](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/59/Chicken-Mushroom-Marsala)

## Preparation (1 hour 30 minutes)

### Ingredients:
* Chicken Breasts ($5)
* Marsala Wine (Trader Joes, $4)
* Heavy Cream (1/2 small container, ~$1.5)
* Potatoes ($1)
* Mushrooms ($3)
* Garlic (1/2 of a head, $.50)

### Stuff you Need On Hand:
* Butter
* Milk
* 1 Egg (if breading)
* Flour or Panko (if breading)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Oil

### Prep Stuff (45 minutes):
* Cook Garlic:
    * Low heat IN WRAPPINGS (2, 3 with diligent stirring) for 25 minutes. Once they\'re sizzling and it obviously smells like roasted garlic, it\'s done.
* Peel Potatoes! Get your potato peeling/cutting time down from 15 minutes, that\'s egregious.
* Preheat oven  to 400 if you're going to do the chicken in there.
* Butter/foil/assemble drop tray and cooking grate thing if baking.
* Butterfly and trim chicken, cut into 0.5x2\" strips.
* If breading:
    * Beat egg
    * Assemble mixture of little bit of cornstarch & panko breadcrumbs or flour+flavorings but panko worked really well this time.
    * Dip in egg, flip around in mix, press mix on because it doesn\'t stick very well.
* Wash mushrooms, set aside to dry.


### Cooking (35 minutes):
* Take garlic off heat as soon as they\'re ready so you can peel them.
* Start potatoes boiling.
* Start cooking chicken. If breading:
    * Heat oil in nonstick pan, fry breaded chickens.
    * OR stick chickens in oven. You might want to do this earlier and finish everything else if you like to be 100% sure your chicken is cooked.
    * Save a 1/2 to a full breast\'s worth unbreaded to cook in a separate, non-nonstick pan so the sauce will taste.
* When done sauteeing chicken, cook mushrooms in browned-burnt bits for ~1 minute, then remove.
* When mushrooms are done, pour wine into pan. (At least 2/3 bottle for two people!) Reduce over next ~10 minutes.
* After wine is reduced and doesn\'t smell so sharp, add cream until desired color is achieved. Allow to reduce over next 5 minutes. CAREFUL with the cream though, I just used a really large quantity of cream and it reduced extremely quickly, forming huge bubbles if not constantly attended to. I looked away for a second and it carmalized... another few seconds and it would have just boiled off into nothing!
    * Add mushrooms and some chickens back into pan while reducing cream to infuse some extra goodness.
    * If smaller quantity of sauce is desired, you can reduce it further for maximum flavor in every drop. Note that the sauce will become sweeter as you reduce it further, reaching an ultimte carmalization stage.
    * If a larger quantity is desired, reduce it until flavor is achieved and then thicken with corn starch.
* Peel and press garlic. You have a garlic press, right?
* Finish potatoes.
* Plate.
