[Original Source: Cooking for Engineers (Michael Chu)](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/59/Chicken-Mushroom-Marsala)

## Preparation (1 hour 30 minutes)

### Ingredients:
* Chicken Breasts ($5)
* Marsala Wine (Trader Joes, $4)
* Heavy Cream (1/2 small container, ~$1.5)
* Potatoes ($1)
* Mushrooms ($3)
* Garlic (1/2 of a head, $.50)

### Stuff you Need On Hand:
* Butter
* Milk
* 1 Egg (if breading)
* Flour (if breading)
* Salt
* Pepper
* Oil

### Before Cooking (30 minutes):
* Cook Garlic:
    * Low heat (2, 3 with diligent stirring) for 25-30 minutes.
* Peel Potatoes!
* Butterfly and trim chicken, cut into 0.5x2\" strips.
* If breading:
    * Beat egg
    * Assemble mixture of flour, breadcrumbs, corn starch, whatever else.
    * Dip in egg, flip around in flour, press flour mix on because it doesn\'t stick very well.
* Wash mushrooms, set on paper towel to dry.

### Cooking (30 minutes):
* Take garlic off heat as soon as they\'re ready so you can peel them.
* Start potatoes boiling.
* Start cooking chicken. If breading:
    * Heat oil in nonstick pan, fry breaded chickens.
    * Save a 1/2 to a full breast\'s worth unbreaded to cook in a separate, non-nonstick pan so the sauce will taste.
* When chicken is done, cook mushrooms in browned-burnt bits for a couple of minutes, then remove.
* When mushrooms are done, pour wine into pan until it\'s about 1/2\" thick. Reduce over next ~10 minutes.
* After wine is reduced and doesn\'t smell so sharp, add cream until desired color is achieved. Allow to reduce over next 5 minutes
    * Add mushrooms and some chickens back into pan while reducing cream to infuse some extra goodness.
    * If smaller quantity of sauce is desired, you can reduce it further for maximum flavor in every drop.
    * If a larger quantity is desired, reduce it until flavor is achieved and then thicken with corn starch.
* Peel and press garlic.
* Finish potatoes.
* Plate.
* Yes.

### Pitfalls (30 minutes)
Maybe I\'m just slow.
