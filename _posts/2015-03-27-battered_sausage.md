# Battered Bangers and Mash

## Mashed Potatoes
* 4 large potatoes was way too much for two people.
* Boil them a little longer! Mashing was difficult.

## Batter
* 1/2c flour
* 1/4c milk
* 1/4c water
* 1.5 Tbs baking powder
* 1 tsp salt.

## Frying
* Near 400 produced relatively a dense and solid casing (in appearance.)
* Nearer to 300 was way too low, I thought, as I watched the batter fall off of the bangers and become like funnel cake in the pot. In the end, though, things came together nicely.
* Right around 330-340, the frying produced a really satisfying (in appearance) texture, and seemed like a good mix of color.

## Serve with
* Salad to offset the sheer heaviness of it all.
* Heinz beans, the british kind.
