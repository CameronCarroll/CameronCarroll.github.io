## Abstract

Fracking is a dirty word in the United States, with an public image to match that of its operators at work. Its economic momentum has, so far, overpowered environmental concerns and, while the American industry practices some self-regulation, whether or not fracking is a good idea remains hotly debated. Many of these environmental concerns stem from the immense technical and logistical challenges involved.

## History

The history of fracking is twofold; On one hand we have an established well stimulation technique, and on the other there is the shale gas boom that technique has unlocked.

The technique of fracturing reservoir bedrock in order to stimulate oil (or now, gas) well production stems back to a practice from the 1800's, ``shooting a well.`` This involved blowing off dynamite at the bottom of a well in order to open up hydrocarbon escape routes. (Sjollander 2011)
